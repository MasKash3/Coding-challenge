# Coding-challenge
The goal was to create a production ready command-line application that will calculate the ranking table for a football league.

The input and output will be text.

The input contains results of games, one per line.
The output should be ordered from most to least points, following the format specified in
“Expected output”.

In this league, a draw (tie) is worth 1 point and a win is worth 3 points. A loss is worth 0 points.
If two or more teams have the same number of points, they should have the same rank and be
printed in alphabetical order (as in the tie for 3rd place in the sample data).
